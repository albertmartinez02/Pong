This is how the pong ball moves. Essentialy, if the ball hits the top half of the wall,
the ball will propel up-right or up-left, depending on its initial direction(determined by our bool,
where a value of true generally moves our ball to the right and up or down, or moves our ball to the
left and up or down.)

If the ball hits the bottom half of the wall, the ball will travel down-right or down-left.

Mathematics involved:
Our x transformations will be set in stone, either left or right. To visually change the position of the ball
we will have to calculate a different y transformation for each collision that makes sense.


Distance Formula:
To determine if the pong ball is hitting the rectangles, perhaps we can EMBED a circle inside the top of the rectangle and bottom of it.
The circle needs to be small enough to not be seen by the player, and we can base our new direction based on which circle it hits.
The question now is where will the hit detection take place? Before or after the rectangle moves?
Let's say before.

20:47 : Time to add movement to player2. This is for debuggin purposes. ^ and V are occupied for player one. Let's try and use
'q' and 'SPACE' for the up and down. 

21:50 : The movement is ALMOST working.... player2 is FAST AF DAWG. Gotta be smart about updating the game speed.
